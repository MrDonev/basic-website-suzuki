     <div id="historyDiv">
<p>In 1909, Michio Suzuki (1887-1982) founded the Suzuki Loom Works in the small seacoast village of Hamamatsu, Japan. 
    Business boomed as Suzuki built weaving looms for Japan's giant silk industry.[10] In 1929, Michio Suzuki invented a new type of weaving 
    machine, which was exported overseas. The company's first 30 years focused on the development and production of these machines.Despite the success of his looms,
     Suzuki believed that his company would benefit from diversification and he began to look at other products. Based on consumer demand, he decided that building a 
     small car would be the most practical new venture. The project began in 1937, and within two years Suzuki had completed several compact prototype cars. These first
      Suzuki motor vehicles were powered by a then-innovative, liquid-cooled,
     four-stroke, four-cylinder engine. It had a cast aluminum crankcase and gearbox and generated 13 horsepower (9.7 kW) from a displacement of less than 800cc.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 33px;">Most iconic Suzuki motorcycles</h1>
    <p class="iconicModels" id="iconKatana"><strong>Suzuki GSX-S1100S Katana</strong>
        Not the re-boot, but the original built back in the early 80s. Prior to this bike, motorcycle design was pretty stoic, and the 
        general look of a machine had remained relatively unchanged since the 1940s. And then the Suzuki Katana arrived and there was a 
        collective thud as the motorcycle industry's jaw hit the floor.
        Styling the bike fell to Hans Muth, ex-BMW head of design, and the company Target Design and the bike's futuristic features didn't 
        stop with the styling. It had a rudimentary form of anti-dive on the front forks, pre-load adjustment on the rear shocks and 110bhp
        which made it not only look like a spaceship - it went like one too.</p>

        <p class="iconicModels" id="iconHayabusa"><strong>GSX1300R Hayabusa</strong>
        Built at a time when the big factories were in an outright fight for world domination, the Hayabusa's battleground 
        was the top-speed war that raged in the mid to late 90s. With over 170bhp and capable of speeds in excess of 180mph, 
        the 'Busa became the king of the autobahn and a favourite with those looking for cheap speed on the road and drag-strip.</p>
        <img src="Suzuki Hayabusa.jpg" alt="big fast mototrcycle" id="img">
        <p class="iconicModels" id="iconGSXR"><strong>Suzuki GSX-R1100</strong>
        In a bid to take the fight to Honda's all-conquering FireBlade, Suzuki tried to use a sledgehammer to crack Honda's 
        proverbial acorn. In an attempt to bolt on more power, the big Gixxer gained water cooling as opposed to oil/air-cooling 
        and the bike ballooned to over 250kg in ready to ride form.
        You could be forgiven for thinking that all this negativity would make the 1100 WP a sales flop, but while sales weren't 
        stellar, the bike's bad-to-the-bone attitude made it a favourite with those who had a penchant for wheelies and making off 
        from the local constabulary at high speed.</p>

        <p class="iconicModels" id="iconBoulevard"><strong>Suzuki Boulevard 1800</strong> is a cruiser style bike and is powered by a huge liquid 
            cooled 1,783 cc V-Twin engine, producing 123 bhp at 6,200 rpm and maximum torque at just 3,200 rpm.The engine benefits from GSX-R tech 
            and is controlled by Suzuki's electronic fuel injection system; you control the first set of two valves while the ECU controls the second 
            based on temperature / pressure data from the air sensor. For maximum flexibility between looking good solo and touring two up Suzuki provide
             both the pillion seat and seat cowl.</p>
